title: Ultrapure water — why 18.2 MΩ·cm collapses in air

**TL;DR:** At 25 °C, pure water has κ ≈ 0.055 µS/cm (ρ ≈ 18.2 MΩ·cm), but air-equilibrated water (~420 ppm CO₂) sits near **pH ≈ 5.6** and **ρ ≈ 1 MΩ·cm**.

**Key relations**
- Charge balance: \([H^+] = K_w/[H^+] + K_1[\mathrm{CO_2^*}]/[H^+] + 2K_1K_2[\mathrm{CO_2^*}]/[H^+]^2\)
- \([\mathrm{CO_2^*}] = K_H p_{\mathrm{CO_2}}\)
- \(\kappa = \sum \lambda_i^\circ [i] / 1000,\ \rho = 1/\kappa\)
